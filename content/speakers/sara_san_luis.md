I love learning new things and I’ve been told that I pass this love on to the rest of the team. I strongly believe that there’s no better place to learn that outside my comfort zone, that’s why I’m always seeking for new opportunities to challenge myself both professionally and personally. And as important as learning is teaching what you learn to others – “knowledge is power, knowledge shared is power multiplied”, that’s the reason why I enjoy so much taking part in technical events as a speaker.

Currently working in the latest Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning and Deep Learning) and Data applications integrating them into working practices and side projects, with a preference for AI for Good projects, as they allow me to use my passion to help people out!
